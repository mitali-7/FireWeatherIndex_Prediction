# FireWeatherIndex_Prediction

Built a Machine Learning regression system to predict the Fire Weather Index (FWI) using daily weather conditions and FWI component indicators from two Algerian regions (June–Sept 2012).
The model learns how factors like temperature, humidity, wind speed, rainfall, and fuel moisture codes influence wildfire severity risk.
A Flask web app is included to input real-time values and instantly generate the predicted FWI for early fire-risk assessment.
